## Predict_Stock_CTG

This repository contains code and data for predicting stock prices of companies listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE) using machine learning techniques.

**Features:**

* **Data Acquisition:** Scripts for downloading historical stock data from reliable sources (e.g., Vietstock, CafeF).
* **Data Preprocessing:** Functions for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for machine learning models.
* **Feature Engineering:** Techniques for extracting relevant features from the raw data, such as moving averages, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis.
* **Model Training:** Implementation of various machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) for stock price prediction.
* **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and visualizations for assessing the performance of the trained models.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
* [Other libraries as needed]

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Devision789/Predict_Stock_CTG.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Usage:**

1. Download historical stock data for the desired companies.
2. Run the preprocessing and feature engineering scripts.
3. Train a machine learning model using the prepared data.
